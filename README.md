# NPS Helper

NPS Helper is the final solo project built during Module 3 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software & Design. Over the course of one week, students select an API of personal interest, then design, build and test a React/Redux web app that displays the received data.

This project was built with the create-react-app starter kit. All tests are executed by Jest and Enzyme, focused on changes to state, React Router, ASYNC functionality, and JSX snapshots. Students continue to build on their experiences of Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, and Single Responsibility principles.
